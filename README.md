## 📌 Overview
This case study analyzes IKEA India’s organizational alignment challenges after its 2018 market entry.  
It applies the Deloitte–Marzo 9S Matrix to identify misalignments and propose actionable recommendations.  
The exercise demonstrates structured thinking, business impact analysis, and consultant‑style communication.

## 🔍 Key Misalignments (by 9S Dimension)

- **Strategy**: IKEA underestimated India’s market adaptation complexity. Large furniture misaligned with small apartment sizes.  
- **Structure**: Dual reporting lines and overlapping KPIs created confusion and slowed decision‑making.  
- **Systems**: Fragmented supply chain platforms delayed launches and created inefficiencies.  
- **Style**: Scandinavian leadership style clashed with hierarchical Indian expectations.  
- **Staff**: Middle management turnover (24.7%) reflected frustration with unclear escalation and limited localization.  
- **Skills**: Workforce lacked advanced retail analytics and localized merchandising expertise.  
- **Shared Values**: IKEA’s values (“togetherness, simplicity”) felt abstract in India, failing to resonate with local hires.  
- **Sustainability**: Global eco‑goals conflicted with India’s cost‑sensitive market; local sourcing compliance strained vendors.  
- **Social Responsibility**: Community engagement lagged behind competitors; “India Market Labs” lacked staffing and was paused.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Strategy**: Localize product mix to fit Indian apartment sizes and consumer preferences.  
- **Structure**: Simplify reporting lines and align KPIs with shared revenue ownership.  
- **Systems**: Integrate Indian and global supply chain platforms with automated workflows.  
- **Style**: Blend global openness with respect for Indian hierarchical norms.  
- **Staff**: Improve retention with localized career pathways and empowerment.  
- **Skills**: Upskill teams in retail analytics and localized merchandising.  
- **Shared Values**: Adapt values to emphasize affordability, family orientation, and community.  
- **Sustainability**: Offer low‑cost eco‑friendly product lines and strengthen vendor QA.  
- **Social Responsibility**: Partner with local NGOs and invest in community programs to build trust.

## ✨ Reflection

### Marzo Additions
The two Marzo additions — **Sustainability** and **Social Responsibility** — reveal alignment issues overlooked by the classic 7‑S model. Sustainability highlights tension between IKEA’s global eco‑friendly commitments and India’s affordability‑driven consumer base. Social Responsibility uncovers weak community integration and stakeholder trust, which are critical in emerging markets. Together, they show that alignment isn’t just internal — it extends outward to society and environment.

### Misalignment Spread
Misalignment in IKEA India cascades across the system. Strategic missteps ripple into structure and systems, creating friction in supply chain and reporting. Leadership style misalignment undermines staff morale, which in turn weakens skills development. Weak shared values prevent cohesion, amplifying silos and cultural friction. Sustainability and social responsibility gaps further erode trust with consumers and regulators. This interconnectedness shows how one weak link propagates across the organization, creating systemic misalignment that slows expansion and damages brand perception.

## 📌 Takeaways
This project taught me how misalignment spreads across complex systems and how structured frameworks like the 9S Matrix can guide clear, actionable solutions.  
It was my **first case study experience**, and it helped me connect **data, organizational context, and business value** in a recruiter‑ready format.
